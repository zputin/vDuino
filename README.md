Virtual Arduino on the Desktop for prototype test/debug/development in a "Hardware Assisted Software Simulation Environment". The hardware assist may be the target hardware itself (or parts of it). The software simulation "runs" the Arduino sketch on the desktop with optional input from and output to a circuit simulator also on the desktop.
